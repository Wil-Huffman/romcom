Wil & Chris

Professionalism 
* 2.5
* I appreciate the humor in your README but it does not tell me what the project is 
* Looks like we have two branches for iteration 0 - we would like to see branches for each feature.
* Commits look good, pretty close to even - some commit messages could be more concise
* LOVE the use of the PR template && the conversations around the code.


JavaScript Style & Implementation
* 2.5
* The code that you have is good. I donâ€™t see repetitive code, and it looks like each of your functions is only doing one thing. 
* There are a couple of things that kept you from a 3:
* Naming conventions are not bad - but `var tgline1` would be more clearly written as `var tagline1` && the variable names could be made to match the class names for readability.`var tgLine2 = document.querySelector(".tagline-1");`
* One console.log left


Functional Expectations 
* 1
    * Functionality does not complete all the expectations of iteration 2.
